# Release Notes

### MimeKit 2.0.4

* The default value of the `CheckCertificateRevocation` property located on the
  `BouncyCastleSecureMimeContext` has been changed to `false` due to privacy concerns noted
  in the <a href="https://efail.de">Efail</a> document published in May of 2018. Clients that
  wish to continue automatic downloads of S/MIME CRLs can manually set the property to `true`.
* Properly wrap long mailbox names with quoted phrases.
* Fixed parsing of header blocks that span across read boundaries. (issue #395)
* Added FormatOptions.EnsureNewLine property (MailKit issue #251)
* Enable System.Net.Mail support for .NET Core 2.0. (issue #393)

### MimeKit 2.0.3

* Allow empty TextBody and HtmlBody properties for BodyBuilder. (issue #391)
* Fixed BodyBuilder.Attachments.Add() to properly handle message/rfc822 attachments.
* Fixed HTML entity encoder logic when a surrogate pair is at the end of the input. (issue #385)

### MimeKit 2.0.2

* IDN encode/decode the local part of mailbox addresses as well. (MailKit issue #649)
* Added a record for .epub to the MimeTypes database. (issue #376)
* Explicitly pass 'false' as the silent argument to SignedCms.ComputeSignature(). (issue #374)
* Make sure the MimeParser does not hang if the last header line is truncated before CRLF.
* Don't use Encoder/DecoderExceptionFallbacks in the TNEF reader. (issue #370)
* Provide a better error message when the cert within a pkcs12 cannot digital sign. (issue #367)
* Fixed TemporarySecureMimeContext to key off the certificate's fingerprint.

### MimeKit 2.0.1

* Improved the HTML parser logic to better handle a number of edge cases.
* MimeKit will now automatically download CRLs based on the CRL Distribution Point
  certificate extension if any HTTP URLs are defined (LDAP and FTP are not yet supported)
  when verifying S/MIME digital signatures using a derivative of the
  BouncyCastleSecureMimeContext backend (the WindowsSecureMimeContext gets this for free
  from System.Security's CMS implementation).
* Fixed OpenPgpContext.RetrievePublicKeyRingAsync() to use the filtered stream.
* Added support for using the Blowfish encryption algorithm with S/MIME (only supported
  in the BouncyCastle backends).
* Added support for using the SEED encryption algorithm with S/MIME (also only supported
  in the BouncyCastle backends).
* Added an optional 'algorithm' argument to OpenPgpContext.GenerateKeyPair() to allow
  specifying the symmetric key algorithm to use in generating the key pair. This defaults
  to AES-256, which is the same value used in older versions of MimeKit.

### MimeKit 2.0.0

* Added IDkimPublicKeyLocator.LookupPublicKeyAsync() and MimeMessage.VerifyAsync() to support
  asynchronous DNS lookups of DKIM public keys.
* Fixed tokenization of unquoted HTML attributes containing entities.
* Vastly improved the WindowsSecureMimeContext to do everything using System.Security
  instead of a mix of System.Security and Bouncy Castle.
* Refactored SecureMimeContext into a base SecureMimeContext and a
  BouncyCastleSecureMimeContext that contained all of the Bouncy Castle-specific logic.
* Added useful extension methods to facilitate conversion between System.Security and
  Bouncy Castle crypto types (such as X509Certificates and AsymmetricAlgorithms).
* Renamed the IContentObject interface to IMimeContent.
* Renamed the ContentObject class to MimeContent.
* Renamed the MimePart.ContentObject property to MimePart.Content.
* Dropped support for .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0.

### MimeKit 1.22.0

* Fixed a buffering bug in MimeParser's header parser. (issue #358)
* Set the TnefReader charset on extracted text/plain and text/html bodies. (issue #357)
* Added safeguard to protect against malformed nested group addresses which could cause
  a stack overflow in the parser. ParserOptions now has a way of limiting the recursive
  depth of rfc822 group addresses using the MaxAddressGroupDepth property. (issue #355)
* Fixed the S/MIME certificate database for .NETStandard by using GetFieldValue() instead
  of GetBytes() which is not supported on .NETStandard. (issue #351)

* Fixed MimeMessage.TextBody to return null when the top-level MIME part is a TextPart
  marked as an attachment.
* Fixed the HtmlToHtml converter to suppress comments if the HtmlTagContext's SuppressInnerContent
  property is active (even if FilterComments is false).
* Documented OpenPgpContext.GenerateKeyPair() which was added in 1.18.0.
* Added OpenPgpContext.Delete() methods to delete public and secret keyrings.
* Added OpenPgpContext.SignKey().
* Remove "Version:" header from armored OpenPGP output. (issue #319)

  as all part of the same name/email address instead of as a separate email address.

  the default database directory. Instead, let the .ctor() create it instead if and when
  an instance of the DefaultSecureMimeContext is created. (issue #285)
* Store DBNull in S/MIME SQL backends for null values (SQLite handles `null` but
  databases such as Postgres do not). (issue #286)

### MimeKit 1.10.1

  don't understand mime-types can more easily intuit what that argument should be.

### MimeKit 1.4.0

* Added support for .NET Core 1.0
* Changed the default value of FormatOptions.AllowMixedHeaderCharsets to false.

  the AttachData property of an Attachment attribute, more metadata is captured
  and translated to the MIME equivalents (such as attachment creation and
  modification times, the size of the attachment, and the display name).
* Migrated the iOS assemblies to Xamarin.iOS Unified API for 64-bit support.

Note: If you are not yet ready to port your iOS application to the Unified API,
      you will need to stick with the 1.0.5 release. The Classic MonoTouch API
