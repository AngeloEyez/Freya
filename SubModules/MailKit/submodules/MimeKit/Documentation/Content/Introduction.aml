      <title>History</title>
      <content>
        <para>
          As a developer and user of email clients, I had come to realize that the vast majority of email
          client (and server) software had less-than-satisfactory MIME implementations. More often than not these
          email clients created broken MIME messages and/or would incorrectly try to parse a MIME message thus
          subtracting from the full benefits that MIME was meant to provide. MimeKit is meant to address this
          issue by following the MIME specification as closely as possible while also providing programmers with
          an extremely easy to use high-level API.
        </para>
        <para>
          This led me, at first, to implement another MIME parser library called
          <externalLink>
            <linkText>GMime</linkText>
            <linkUri>http://spruce.sourceforge.net/gmime</linkUri>
            <linkTarget>_blank</linkTarget>
          </externalLink>
          which was implemented in C and later added a C# binding called GMime-Sharp.
        </para>
        <para>
          Now that I typically find myself working in C# rather than lower level languages like C, I decided
          to begin writing a new parser in C# which would not depend on GMime. This would also allow me to have
          more flexibility in that I'd be able use Generics and create a more .NET-compliant API.

        <para>
          While mainstream beliefs may suggest that C# can never be as fast as C, it turns out that with a bit
          of creative parser design and a few clever optimizations

        </para>
        <para>
          Since GMime is pretty well-known as a high-performance native MIME parser and MimeKit more-or-less
          matches GMime's performance, it stands to reason that MimeKit is likely unsurpassed in performance in
          the .NET MIME parser space.

        <para>
          For a comparison, as I <externalLink>

            <linkTarget>_blank</linkTarget>
          </externalLink> (I have since optimized MimeKit by at least another 30%), MimeKit is more than 25x faster than
          OpenPOP.NET, 75x faster than SharpMimeTools, and 65x faster than regex-based parsers. Even the commercial MIME
          parser offerings such as LimiLabs' Mail.dll and NewtonIdeas' Mime4Net cannot even come close to matching
          MimeKit's performance (they are both orders of magnitude slower than MimeKit).

          MimeKit and MailKit are personal open source projects that I have put thousands of hours into perfecting
          by continuously improving the API based on feedback from developers like yourself, writing documentation,
          and optimizing with the goal of making them not only the very best email framework for .NET, but the best
          email framework for any programming language. I need your help to achieve this.
