Hello!

The GnuPG team is pleased to announce the availability of a new release
of GnuPG: version 2.1.20.  See below for a list of new features and bug
fixes.


About GnuPG
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is a complete and free implementation
of the OpenPGP standard which is commonly abbreviated as PGP.

GnuPG allows to encrypt and sign data and communication, features a
versatile key management system as well as access modules for public key
directories.  GnuPG itself is a command line tool with features for easy
integration with other applications.  A wealth of frontend applications
and libraries making use of GnuPG are available.  As an Universal Crypto
Engine GnuPG provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell in addition to
OpenPGP.

GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom).  It can
be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.1.20
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  * gpg: New properties 'expired', 'revoked', and 'disabled' for the
    import and export filters.

  * gpg: New command --quick-set-primary-uid.

  * gpg: New compliance field for the --with-colon key listing.

  * gpg: Changed the key parser to generalize the processing of local
    meta data packets.

  * gpg: Fixed assertion failure in the TOFU trust model.

  * gpg: Fixed exporting of zero length user ID packets.

  * scd: Improved support for multiple readers.

  * scd: Fixed timeout handling for key generation.

  * agent: New option --enable-extended-key-format.

  * dirmngr: Do not add a keyserver to a new dirmngr.conf.  Dirmngr
    uses a default keyserver.

  * dimngr: Do not treat TLS warning alerts as severe error when
    building with GNUTLS.

  * dirmngr: Actually take /etc/hosts in account.

  * wks: Fixed client problems on Windows.  Published keys are now set
    to world-readable.

  * tests: Fixed creation of temporary directories.

  * A socket directory for a non standard GNUGHOME is now created on
    the fly under /run/user.  Thus "gpgconf --create-socketdir" is now
    optional.  The use of "gpgconf --remove-socketdir" to clean up
    obsolete socket directories is however recommended to avoid
    cluttering /run/user with useless directories.

  * Fixed build problems on some platforms.


A detailed description of the changes found in this 2.1 branch can be
found at <https://gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html>.


Getting the Software
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Please follow the instructions found at <https://gnupg.org/download/> or
read on:

GnuPG 2.1.20 may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or
direct from its primary FTP server.  The list of mirrors can be found at
<https://gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html>.  Note that GnuPG is not
available at ftp.gnu.org.

The GnuPG source code compressed using BZIP2 and its OpenPGP signature
are available here:

 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2 (6304k)
 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2.sig

or via FTP:

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2=20
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2.sig

An installer for Windows without any graphical frontend except for a
very minimal Pinentry tool is available here:

 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.1.20_20170403.exe  (3755k)
 https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.1.20_20170403.exe.sig

or via FTP:

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.1.20_20170403.exe
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.1.20_20170403.exe.sig

The source used to build the Windows installer can be found in the same
directory with a ".tar.xz" suffix.  The Windows installer now comes with
TOFU support, many translations, support for Tor, and support for HKPS
and the Web Key Directory.


Checking the Integrity
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of
the following ways:

 * If you already have a version of GnuPG installed, you can simply
   verify the supplied signature.  For example to verify the signature
   of the file gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2 you would use this command:

     gpg --verify gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2.sig gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2

   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
   You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
   made by one or more of the release signing keys.  Make sure that
   this is a valid key, either by matching the shown fingerprint
   against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by
   checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys.
   See the end of this mail for information on the signing keys.

 * If you are not able to use an existing version of GnuPG, you have
   to verify the SHA-1 checksum.  On Unix systems the command to do
   this is either "sha1sum" or "shasum".  Assuming you downloaded the
   file gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2, you run the command like this:

     sha1sum gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2

   and check that the output matches the next line:

500ddae8e4225ae2e300934090f9b9a427b8def1  gnupg-2.1.20.tar.bz2
69308ee80699ebb48a055963418597767a76d1d8  gnupg-w32-2.1.20_20170403.exe
6d9054625a6515971fd121e6648f6d0b0d4d9e44  gnupg-w32-2.1.20_20170403.tar.xz


Internationalization
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This version of GnuPG has support for 26 languages with Chinese, Czech,
French, German, Japanese, Norwegian, Russian, and Ukrainian being almost
completely translated.  Due to expected changes in forthcoming releases
some strings pertaining to the TOFU code are not yet translated.


Documentation
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

If you used GnuPG in the past you should read the description of
changes and new features at doc/whats-new-in-2.1.txt or online at

  https://gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html

The file gnupg.info has the complete user manual of the system.
Separate man pages are included as well but they have not all the
details available as are the manual.  It is also possible to read the
complete manual online in HTML format at

  https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/

or in Portable Document Format at

  https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg.pdf .

The chapters on gpg-agent, gpg and gpgsm include information on how
to set up the whole thing.  You may also want search the GnuPG mailing
list archives or ask on the gnupg-users mailing lists for advise on
how to solve problems.  Many of the new features are around for
several years and thus enough public knowledge is already available.

You may also want to follow our postings at <https://gnupg.org/blob/>
and <https://twitter.com/gnupg>.
