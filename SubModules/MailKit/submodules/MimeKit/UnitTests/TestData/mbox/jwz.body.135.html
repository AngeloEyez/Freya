<html><body>Hi -<br/><br/>     Here is some audio mail from me.  I don&#39;t have a microphone at hand, and<br/>it&#39;s Sunday, so I can&#39;t go to a Radio Shack!.  So, I&#39;m using a speaker as a<br/>mike!  Anyway, let me know if you were able to interpret it.<br/><br/>     I still haven&#39;t figured out how to do anything useful with the image<br/>formats.  I need either TIFF or EPS.<br/><br/>-- Mark --<br/></body></html>
