<html><body>Hi everyone.  I&#39;m a consultant working with Nortel on their S/MIME products.<br/>I&#39;ve already completed basic interop testing against Deming&#39;s Secure<br/>Messenger and at Blake&#39;s suggestion I am about to post a signed message to<br/>this list for others to use in interop testing.  If you have questions about<br/>Entrust in general, please visit their web site &lt;<a href="http://www.entrust.com">http://www.entrust.com</a>&gt;.  If<br/>you have questions about the forthcoming S/MIME toolkit for Entrust please<br/>email Michel Ranger &lt;<a href="mailto:rangerm@entrust.com">mailto:rangerm@entrust.com</a>&gt; or Ron Vandergeest<br/>&lt;<a href="mailto:rvander@entrust.com">mailto:rvander@entrust.com</a>&gt;.  E-mail any technical interop-related questions<br/>directly to me &lt;<a href="mailto:rosenqui@strataware.com">mailto:rosenqui@strataware.com</a>&gt;.<br/><br/>One big thing you should be aware of with Entrust is that it uses separate<br/>key pairs for signing and encryption, so you must be careful to distinguish<br/>between my verification certificate and my signature certificate.  You<br/>should import *this* certificate into your local database if you want to be<br/>able to encrypt for me.  For now, signed S/MIME messages created with the<br/>Entrust toolkit will include both certificates for the originator as well<br/>as the originator&#39;s CA certificate.  Eventually this will be under the<br/>programmatic control of whatever app is using the toolkit, so it&#39;s<br/>important that you look at the certificate you&#39;re importing to make sure<br/>it&#39;s the one you want.  You can tell which one you&#39;ve got by looking at the<br/>keyUsage V3 cert extension (object identifier 2.5.29.15).  The encryption<br/>certificate has the keyEncipherment bit set (bit number 2 or 0x20) and the<br/>verification certificate has the digitalSignature bit set (bit number 0 or<br/>0x80).<br/><br/>One other thing that some of you may not have encountered before is that my<br/>CA is not Verisign.  Included in the P7C (as well as my signed S/MIME<br/>messages) is my CA&#39;s certificate - a self-signed certificate.  You can<br/>distinguish this form of certificate (a self-signed CA) from a self-signed<br/>user certificate by looking for the keyCertSign (bit 5) or cRLSign (bit 6)<br/>bits in the keyUsage extension.  Failing that, you can look for the<br/>basicConstraints extension to see if the &#39;cA&#39; BOOLEAN field is present and<br/>TRUE.<br/><br/>Without further ado, here is my encryption certificate and my CA&#39;s<br/>signature verification certificate.  I&#39;m away all of next week, so if you<br/>have questions or discover any problems please e-mail me ASAP.  If you<br/>don&#39;t get a reply by the end of Friday I&#39;ll try to get back to you as soon<br/>as possible after Dec. 2nd.<br/><br/>Eric<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Eric Rosenquist, Strata Software Limited   <a href="http://www.strataware.com/">http://www.strataware.com/</a><br/><a href="mailto:rosenqui@strataware.com">mailto:rosenqui@strataware.com</a>   Tel: 613-591-1922  Fax: 613-591-3485<br/>Quote: I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch!<br/>         -- Homer Simpson<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></body></html>
