<html><body>Once again, Scott Turner drops another clueless and mendacious tirade.  It&#39;s<br/>obvious he hasn&#39;t made more than a cursory glimpse of the MIME document.  It&#39;s<br/>equally obvious he knows nothing about the specifications of Internet mail as<br/>described in RFC-821 and RFC-822 [those *are* standards, even NeXT uses them].<br/>However, it doesn&#39;t stop him from making any number of absurd, false, and<br/>downright foolish statements.<br/><br/>He&#39;s just as clueless about the meaning of the Japanese word `gaijin&#39;, yet<br/>that too doesn&#39;t stop him from making a racist assumption of its meaning and<br/>proceeding on that.  &#227;&#227;&#65390;&#231;&#65395;&#227;&#65379;&#229;&#227;<br/><br/>When challenged to put his code where his big mouth is, all he does is go on<br/>about how he is `too busy making $$$&#39; and `does not have enough time&#39; to do<br/>so.  In other words, the standard retreat of the nasty little net.geek who<br/>probably is in Programming I.<br/><br/>It&#39;s not worth it.  If anyone believes what Turner has to say, then PT Barnum<br/>was right about what was born every minute.<br/></body></html>
