<html><body>I recently got hold of a filter that <a href="mailto:davecb@nexus.yorku.ca">davecb@nexus.yorku.ca</a> wrote, and while<br/>it&#39;s not perfect, at least I&#39;ve been able to take the &quot;No NeXTmail!&quot; slogan<br/>out of my .signature.  And now that I just thought of such a terrible pun,<br/>as is in the Subject: above, I couldn&#39;t resist inflicting it on someone,<br/>and you seem to be the most appropriate victim.  Anyhow, I guess this is a<br/>&quot;fan letter:&quot; thanks for MIME.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/></body></html>
