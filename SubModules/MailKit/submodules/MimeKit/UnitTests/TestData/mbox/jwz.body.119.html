<html><body>Jamie -<br/><br/>I tried to sign and encrypt this message, but when I did I received the<br/>following error:<br/><br/>The certificate issuer for this server is not recognized by Netscape.  <br/>The security certificate may or may not be valid.  Netscape refuses to<br/>connect to this server.<br/><br/>I also got this error when I tried only to encrypt the message.  However<br/>with digital signing it seems to work ok.  From the error message, I<br/>don&#39;t know whether the server in error is my mail server, certificate<br/>server, or a server on your end.  Our mail server is Netscape mail<br/>server v1.1 and Certificate Server 1.0.<br/><br/>Thanks for the help,<br/>Dan<br/></body></html>
