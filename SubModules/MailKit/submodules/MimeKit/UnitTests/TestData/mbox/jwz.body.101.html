<html><body>Dear S/MIME developers,<br/><br/>   I believe that this is a valid S/MIME multipart/signed message. The<br/>implementation is still quite experimental, so as yet I have no way of<br/>verifying that it is, in fact valid. The code is quite similar to my<br/>PGP/MIME and MOSS multipart/signed implementations, so there&#39;s reason<br/>to believe it works, but, then again, a lot can go wrong.<br/><br/>   If anyone can verify this message or tell me where I went wrong, it<br/>would be much appreciated.<br/><br/>   By the way, there&#39;s a minor nit to pick in the S/MIME message<br/>format document. After clearly (and correctly) calling out the fact<br/>that MIME parameters including slashes need to be quoted, the example<br/>of the multipart/signed at the end of the document is lacking quotes.<br/><br/>   Also, when the spec is finalized, it would be nice if the examples<br/>had valid PKCS data :-)<br/><br/>Raph (who really needs to get some sleep after staying up past 4am)<br/></body></html>
