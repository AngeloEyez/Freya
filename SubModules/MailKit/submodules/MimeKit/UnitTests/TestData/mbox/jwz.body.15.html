<html><body>I&#39;m in my office now, so I can see the picture you sent me without<br/>extreme slowness.  Very nice.  As for your questions:<br/><br/>The white space in your name was an accident on my part -- sorry about that.<br/><br/>The characters you didn&#39;t recognize -- in my From: field &amp; my signature<br/>-- are my name in Hebrew.  It&#39;s pronounced &quot;Naftali Ben Shalom&quot;.<br/><br/>When you say that it isn&#39;t easy to do multilingual mail in MIME, I<br/>presume what you mean is that it&#39;s a pain to have multiple parts, each<br/>of them plain text in a different character set?  If that&#39;s what you<br/>mean, I agree.  This will only be solved when the ISO 10646 and Unicode<br/>folks finish their work and give us a &quot;one-world&quot; character set.  I look<br/>forward to that day!  -- Nathaniel<br/></body></html>
