<html><body>For &quot;The Simple Times&quot;, the openly-available SNMP newsletter which I<br/>edit, there are two editions: a PostScript edition and a MIME edition.<br/>Both are really MIME messages: the former is just a single<br/>application/postscript content, the latter is a highly-structured<br/>multipart/mixed content which contains text/plain at the leaves.<br/><br/>I am planning on adding a third edition, richtext, which will be like<br/>the text/plain edition, except all the leafs will be text/richtext.<br/><br/>I have a couple of crude scripts which take the LaTeX subset I use and<br/>produce richtext.  The only problematic area is handling itemize<br/>environments.  Ideally, I&#39;d like to do a bulleted list, but there really<br/>isn&#39;t a richtext directive for this.  So, I&#39;ve done a hack.<br/><br/>For those of you that are running Borenstein&#39;s richtext viewer (or have<br/>your own), I&#39;d like you to take a look at the message below and tell me<br/>what you think of it.  Is it &quot;rich&quot; enough?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>/mtr<br/></body></html>
