This will avoid problems the<br/>receiving MUA will have in parsing non-typed fields (such as PARAM<br/>fields in OBJECT tags) that are contained in the html.  In the case<br/>where the email message contains MICs, it may be necessary for the<br/>sending MUA to use the Content-Location method (as defined in section<br/>8.2) in order for the receiving MUA to be able to verify the MICS, as<br/>well as to verify the message against its WWW counterpoint.<br/><br/></blockquote><br/>I for one agree with this change.  MICs aside the &quot;cid:&quot; approach<br/>is much easier to implement (speaking from experience).<br/></body></html>
