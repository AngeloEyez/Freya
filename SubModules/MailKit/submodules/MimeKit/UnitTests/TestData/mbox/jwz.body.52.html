Apparently I have been<br/>completely off track; however it is amazing that you are the first to<br/>point that out. Others have lead me into the wilderness, saying for<br/>example that it is a problem with my SMTP client.<br/><br/>When I asked about this in comp.unix.aux last year (we were using 5.65<br/>back then), Jim Jagielski told me:<br/><blockquote>Well, it&#39;s not &quot;well known&quot; but it _is_ a bug in sendmail 5.64 and 5.65...<br/><br/>smail and sendmail 8.?.? don&#39;t suffer from this..<br/></blockquote><br/>We have been running A/UX sendmail almost straight out of the box here. So<br/>when Apple released 8.6.9, we thought everything would be fine. Apparently<br/>Apple delivers something that is not exactly in a working condition, now<br/>why didn&#39;t we expect that?<br/><br/><blockquote>Please check it first. <br/><br/>It is probable that usage of /bin/mail don&#39;t match mailer flags what is<br/>tell to sendmail in Mlocal -line.<br/></blockquote><br/>That will be it!<br/><br/>I cannot thank you enough for being so crystal clear about this!<br/><br/>This followup is cross-posted to comp.unix.aux, as there are probably more<br/>A/UX systems running straight out of the box with this problem waiting to<br/>strike without warning.<br/><br/>--<br/>Lasse Hiller&#248;e Petersen     ! &quot;If others had not been foolish,<br/>Systems Administrator       !  we would be so!&quot;<br/>Information &amp; Media Science !                -William Blake<br/>Aarhus University, DENMARK  !<br/></body></html>
