<html><body>Your Slate-generated MIME mail looks almost perfect.  After all these years of each of us having multimedia mail but only being able to exchange ASCII, it is an incredible pleasure to be able to interchange non-text mail, with me still using Andrew and you still using Slate!&lt;nl&gt;<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>I tested your message in my two MIME implementations, Andrew and metamail.  It worked perfectly with Andrew.  It also worked perfectly with metamail, but metamail generated one warning message that points to a very minor syntactic irregularity in your use of MIME.  You used the content-type:&lt;nl&gt;<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>Content-Type: multipart/mixed; &lt;nl&gt;<br/>	boundary=&quot;SlateBoundary_1_Fri_Feb_5_09:44:55_1993_E9C1BD&quot;;&lt;nl&gt;<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>If you read the grammar carefully, the semicolon that separates parameters is attached to the FOLLOWING parameter.  By ending with a trailing semicolon, you&#39;re ever-so-slightly out of spec.  Andrew just ignored this, but metamail generated an anal-retentive and obscure warning message of the form:&lt;nl&gt;<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>Ignoring unparsable content-type parameter: &#39;&#39;&lt;nl&gt;<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>You probably ought to omit that last semicolon, really.&lt;nl&gt;<br/> <br/></body></html>
