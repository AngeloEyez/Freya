<html><body>I am sending this message to a few people who have established <br/>themselves, in the past, as relatively friendly consumers of <br/>experimental multimedia mail.  What I&#39;d like to ascertain is how <br/>well this latest type of installed mail works in a variety of <br/>mail reading environments.<br/><br/>I expect that, in any event, you will have no trouble reading <br/>the English part of this message.  The more interesting question <br/>is how things like the next line will look to you:<br/><br/>!&#1501;&#1493;&#1500;&#1513;<br/><br/>If you&#39;re running X11 and things are working right, that should <br/>have been the Hebrew word &quot;Shalom&quot;.   Please let me know if <br/>that&#39;s not what it looked like to you.  (Non-hebrew readers, please <br/>give me your best guess as to whether or not what you saw <br/>was Hebrew characters!)<br/><br/>Just for completeness, here&#39;s the Hebrew alphabet:<br/><br/>&#1488;&#1489;&#1490;&#1491;&#1492;&#1493;&#1494;&#1495;&#1496;&#1497;&#1498;&#1499;&#1500;&#1501;&#1502;&#1503;&#1504;&#1505;&#1506;&#1507;&#1508;&#1509;&#1510;&#1511;&#1512;&#1513;<br/><br/>Unfortunately, composing &#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1489;&#1506; is still a serious nuisance, <br/>with no good software support at all for the composer, but receipt is <br/>always the first step in these things, which are best taken one step <br/>at a time.      !&#1496;&#1488;&#1500;, &#1496;&#1488;&#1500;<br/></body></html>
