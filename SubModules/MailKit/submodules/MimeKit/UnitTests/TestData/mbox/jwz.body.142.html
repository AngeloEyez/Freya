<html><body>We have been building an X based mail user agent this year and following<br/>the development of RFC-XXXX along the way. The first version of the<br/>system uses RFC1049 style content-type header but now we are converting<br/>it it use RFC-XXXX. The latest draft we have is October, will there be a<br/>new one out soon? Where can we get it?<br/><br/>We took your great idea of a mailcap file but extended it so that it<br/>specifies &quot;composer&quot; and &quot;editor&quot; progrms as well as viewers for each<br/>type. It becomes very easy to plug in a new drawing program etc this<br/>way. <br/><br/>I&#39;ve attached a photo taken at the Australian Networkshop91 held last<br/>week. The people developing X500 directory services in Australia had a<br/>booth with a TV camera connected to a Mac and a Decstation with sound<br/>I/O. They were taking people&#39;s pictures and getting them to say hello<br/>and putting the data into the X500 database. With appropriate directory<br/>user agents you can get my details + a photo and voice message!<br/><br/>Bob<br/></body></html>
