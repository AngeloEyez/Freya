<html><body><br/>&lt;Indent&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;IndentRight&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;bigger&gt;<br/> Nathaniel, <br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>I think the biggest problem with point size in the mail I sent you earlier was my own<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>misinterpretation of the rtf  &quot;fs&quot; command.  It was not documented in my (sparse)<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>RTF documentation but I guessed from context that it was point size.  I&#39;ve done more<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>experimenting since then and concluded that it is consistently twice point size.  So<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>instead of a mixture of 12 to 24 point my previous message to you was 24 to 48 point.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>I didn&#39;t see it here because I either read it with metamail and no font software, or looped<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>it back and read it on the NeXT where everything reversed itself.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>It should be fixed here:<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>	This is 12 point.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>	<br/>&lt;bigger&gt;<br/> This is 14 point.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>	<br/>&lt;bigger&gt;<br/> This is 16 point.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/bigger&gt;<br/> This is back to 12 point.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>I do have some followup questions.  Can I close a &quot;bigger&quot; environment with a &quot;smaller&quot;<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>and vice-versa?  I was  doing that but for safety&#39;s sake I now use, e.g. &quot;/smaller&quot; when<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>growing and the current point size is less than 10, but &quot;bigger&quot; when growing and the<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>current point size is 10 or greater.  Is this necessary?<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>I also have a question about external-body messages.  If I have a multipart message it<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>would be nice to make the first external-body segment  ftp, with parameters that would<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>cause it to essentially mget all the files, so later segments could be local-file.  To do that<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>I really want the first ftp call to mget all the files, create a subdirectory on the user&#39;s host,<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>and put the files into the subdirectory.  One way to do that would be to make the NAME<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>on the ftp access type the basename of the directory containing the message and make<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>the MODE &quot;directory&quot; or &quot;recursive&quot; or some such.  But it needs to be something well<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>defined for all the MIME readers.  Any thoughts on this?<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>Finally, I&#39;m pursuing the problem where WIN/3b munched my Content-type line.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>I t&#39;s Wollongong rather tha attmail, but I haven&#39;t heard back yet from Wollongong.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>A &quot;content-length&quot; caption was added in as the content-type line was mangled,<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>so I suspect WIN/3b sendmail has its own private interpretation of content-type.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>Until then I&#39;ve shortened my boundary down to 5 lower case characters so this<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>message shouldn&#39;t cause the trouble the last one did.<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>Thanks for your help,<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/>Marty<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><a href="mailto:robb@sblab.att.com">robb@sblab.att.com</a><br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/><br/>&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;smaller&gt;&lt;smaller&gt;&lt;smaller&gt;<br/></body></html>
