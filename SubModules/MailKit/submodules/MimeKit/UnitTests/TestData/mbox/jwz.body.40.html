<html><body>2 Questions:<br/><br/>1) MM_QUIET doesn&#39;t seem to work in the 212 version of metamail.<br/><br/>2) I&#39;ve been pondering how I am going to send you this 40mb mail message.<br/>   I was going to split it up using the &quot;parts&quot; mechanism, but then it occurred to me.<br/>   My software has no business worrying about message size.  Its up to the mail<br/>   delivery agent to do that form me.  I should be able to compose a very<br/>   long message, and pass it off to sendmail (well, a pre-processor to sendmail).<br/>   if the message is too long, based upon the src/dst etc, then sendmail should<br/>   break it into multiple parts for me, and send it as multiple messages.  As the<br/>   user (sender) I should be unaware this is happening.<br/><br/>   Similarly, on the receiving end, the separate parts should be assembled as they<br/>   arrive; I shouldn&#39;t have do deal with them at all as multiple messages.<br/><br/>   I guess what I am proposing are two utility programs:<br/><br/>       msplit &lt;max_lines&gt; &lt;max_bytes&gt;<br/><br/>   that takes 1 mail message and splits it into N messages and<br/><br/>       mcombine &lt;parts...&gt;<br/>       mcombine &lt;partially_assembled_thingy&gt; &lt;parts...&gt;<br/><br/>   that any mail system can call to achieve a uniform mechanism of splitting<br/>   and recombining messages,  Kind of like:<br/></body></html>
