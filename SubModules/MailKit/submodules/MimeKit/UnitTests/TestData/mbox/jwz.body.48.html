<html><body>Marshall -- sorry it took so long.  Since I assume you&#39;ve already seen what your MIME Simple Times looks like using the richtext program, I thought I&#39;d check it out using the MIME implementation in the latest Andrew.  Aside from the fact that it re-tickled a bug I&#39;m aware of in the support for multipart/digest (which I&#39;m planning to fix, don&#39;t worry) it looked really nice.  I&#39;m enclosing some screen dumps to show you what it looked like, in parts, using Andrew.   There were a few places where I think some &lt;lt&gt;nl&gt; tokens should have been added, but basically it looked great.  (In particular, if you have two consecutive richtext parts, I think you assumed there was a linebreak between them, but there isn&#39;t -- you need to be explicit about it.  That&#39;s how Andrew handles in-line pictures, for example.  You&#39;ll see what I mean in the first of the enclosed snapshots.)  &lt;nl&gt;<br/>&lt;nl&gt;<br/></body></html>
